Do NOT summarize any content.\r\n2. Do NOT rephrase any part of the text.\r\n3. Do NOT translate the text.\r\n4. Do NOT split inside a sentence.\r\n5. Do NOT add, remove, or alter any words, unless explicitly instructed.\r\n6.

  "context": "You help improve retrieval for text chunks in a vector database.\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n- The full source document.\r\n- One specific chunk taken from that document.\r\n\r\nTask:\r\n- Write a short context paragraph of about 50–500 words.\r\n- The context should describe where this chunk belongs in the overall document (topic, section, purpose, important entities, abbreviations, etc.).\r\n- Do NOT rewrite or quote the chunk itself.\r\n- Do NOT mention \"chunk\" or \"document\" explicitly.\r\n- Just output the context paragraph, nothing else."
